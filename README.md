WEATHER-band website
=====

For my personal project I got intouch with an old friend from LA who was looking for someone to build them a website for their band, WEATHER. I took the opportunity to build a site that will be launched and used to promote the band. For this project I used Pantheon as a host, and Wordpress as a development tool. Having not used Wordpress before, I felt it was a good opportunity to further my education in web development.

I found wWordpress to be similair to drupal 7, but with better development control. Editing the code for plugins appears to be easier since you can access the code through the edit function under the plug-ins menu item under dashboard in the development environment. 

Work will be continuing n the site, as requirements are refined by the client. The development site can be viewed at:
